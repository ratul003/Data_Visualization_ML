### Data_Visualization_ML

Matplotlib is a Python package for 2D plotting that generates production-quality graphs. Matplotlib tries to make easy things easy and hard things possible. We can generate plots, histograms, power spectra, bar charts, errorcharts, scatterplots, etc., with just a few lines of code.

Seaborn is a Python visualization library based on matplotlib. Most developers will use seaborn if the same functionally exists in both matplotlib and seaborn.

I have generated few Data Visuals using the underlying Statistical Concepts used to generate and explain data.
